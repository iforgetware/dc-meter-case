3D printed case for SMAKN LED Voltmeter Ammeter

openscad model that uses a SMAKN LED Voltmeter Ammeter with shunts and AMP power pole modular plugs to create a constant-use DC volt/amp meter with 3 circuits for different current loads ( 0-10, 10-20, 20-100 in my case ).

Everything is modular and paramaterized which helps cut the time of test prints and allows what tuning I needed.

This is a 0.5 version at best.
Improvements needed

cover screws are too long. countersink.
